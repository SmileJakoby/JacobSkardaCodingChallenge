Completed in 3 hours and 10 minutes.
Spent 2 hours completing the project.
Spent 1 hour adding a hard difficulty.
Spent 10 minutes cleaning up code.

I'm sure there's a less repetitive way to program this, but I was worried about the 
time constraint and knew that I could finish it in 4 hours easily, even if it was repetitious.

I didn't write any digital notes other than the coding comments.
The 2 pictures included are some simple and quick charts figuring out every possibility that the
hard bot would have to check for.
